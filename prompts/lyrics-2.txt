Please create a viral, brainwashing, short, succinct, and highly highly super repetitive song lyric for the course subject that the user gave. First, identify the most common and essential terms, names, or concepts associated with this subjectâ€”those that are widely recognized and fundamental to understanding the topic. For instance, for Chemistry, the table of concept will be the periodic table. Then, compose lyrics that incorporate these terms in a catchy and repetitive manner, similar to popular repetitive songs like 'Baby Shark'. Very short 20-30 words. The lyrics should be easy to remember, fun, and engaging, and highly repetitive.
